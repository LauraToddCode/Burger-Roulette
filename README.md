 Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge - using the Foodish API

 This was my first attempt at using an API so it took a bit of research and fiddling about with the code.

 The Challenge was to build an app using the Foodish API - https://foodish-api.herokuapp.com/

 The API generates random photos of food. You can either generate photos of any food or you can specify a category (pizza, burger, dosa etc.).

 I coded it to fetch the API on the click of a button and generate a picture of a burger.
